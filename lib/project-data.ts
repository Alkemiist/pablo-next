        fullDescription: "Electrify the City is an immersive AR-driven campaign that reimagines iconic urban landmarks as glowing, Nissan-branded light installations powered by ARIYA. Using an Instagram or mobile AR filter, users can point their devices at buildings, plazas, or bridges and watch them come alive with dynamic animations and overlays infused with Nissan's EV DNA. Influencers and local creators will seed content to spark exploration and social sharing, turning the campaign into a cultural conversation. The experience culminates with a nighttime public event—powered by ARIYA batteries—projecting light sequences onto real landmarks. It's a blending of technology, design, and civic pride that positions Nissan as both innovative and community-minded.",

        trend: "Urban landscapes are morphing into interactive, digital-first canvases as brands lean into AR, immersive installations, and pop-up culture to engage younger audiences. These consumers increasingly value shared experiences—moments worthy of a post—over passive brand messaging. At the same time, electric vehicles are gaining traction but often remain abstract symbols of sustainability. By activating AR in real city spaces and tying it to EV storytelling, Nissan humanizes the charge toward electrification—making it visible, poetic, and culturally resonant. This aligns with the experiential marketing trend that blends physical and digital worlds to create emotionally compelling brand connections.",
