  "name": "The Courage Engine ",
  "dnaSummary": "Transforms moral defiance into mainstream admiration, creating a bridge between belief and belonging.",
  "originalCampaign": "Nike’s Dream Crazy transformed the brand from a symbol of performance to a beacon of purpose.\nBy centering on Colin Kaepernick — an athlete who sacrificed his career to protest racial injustice — Nike shifted its “Just Do It” ethos from physical daring to moral courage.\nThe campaign became a global statement that standing for something is the ultimate act of greatness.",
  "coreMechanism": "Reframe moral defiance as mainstream heroism.\nThe brand spotlights individuals who challenge convention and transforms their conviction into collective inspiration.\nInstead of selling a product, it sells belief — turning courage itself into a consumer aspiration.\n\nMechanism Pattern: Reframing → Cultural defiance → Moral aspiration",
  "psychologicalDrivers": "Identity Aspiration: People want to be seen as brave, principled, and aligned with justice. Righteous Pride: It validates the human need to feel morally courageous. Defiant Belonging: It builds a tribe around shared values and bravery. Moral Self-Signal: Wearing or buying becomes a declaration of belief. These triggers make the campaign feel participatory — buying Nike is joining the movement.",
  "culturalTension": "Conflict: Athletes and citizens were being silenced or punished for activism.\nResolution: Nike amplified those silenced voices, declaring that courage to speak truth is the new definition of greatness.\nBy doing so, it resolved cultural anxiety with empowerment — giving people permission to take a stand.",
  "archetypeAlignment": "Primary Archetype: The Rebel — challenges established systems.\nSecondary Archetype: The Martyr — sacrifices comfort for a greater cause.\nTogether, they create a narrative that celebrates risk, sacrifice, and conviction.",
  "transferableEssence": "Elevate acts of conviction or courage to redefine what greatness means — in any context.\nShift the narrative from performance to purpose.\nThis idea can inspire any brand that seeks to embody bravery, authenticity, or integrity in the face of convention.",
  "contextDependencies": "Works best when the brand has credibility in values or social purpose. Requires a social climate where authenticity and conviction are culturally rewarded. Most effective during moments of moral tension or cultural transformation.\n\nWithout these conditions, the mechanism risks feeling hollow or performative.",
  "risksAndTradeoffs": "Risks:\n\t•\tPolarization and backlash from opposing audiences.\n\t•\tPublic skepticism about sincerity or “woke-washing.”\n\nTrade-Offs:\n\t•\tSacrifices mass-market neutrality for deep cultural relevance.\n\t•\tShifts focus from product benefits to ideological storytelling.\n\nThese trade-offs build emotional resonance but demand long-term brand consistency.",
  "formatAgnosticism": "This mechanism can live across multiple channels because it’s rooted in an emotional truth, not a format.\nIt can manifest as:\n\t•\tManifesto films\n\t•\tOOH storytelling\n\t•\tInfluencer or athlete narratives\n\t•\tExperiential activism events\n\t•\tLong-form brand documentaries\n\nEvery medium amplifies the same emotional voltage: conviction as power.",
