  "name": "The New Baby Boom",
  "description": "After years of delayed parenthood, the world is witnessing a cultural rebound — a new wave of families forming across millennial and Gen Z demographics. Parenthood has become aspirational again, reshaped by modern values of wellness, intentionality, and balance. The “new baby boom” is less about numbers and more about mindset: people are reimagining what raising a family means in an age of design, technology, and emotional awareness.",
  "coreDrivers": "Rising economic stability post-pandemic, hybrid work flexibility, and a cultural shift toward home-centered living have made family life more attainable and desirable. Social media has also normalized modern parenting — blending realness, humor, and aesthetics in ways that make family life aspirational instead of intimidating.",
  "keyBehaviors": "More parents sharing authentic family life online, surging baby product innovation, suburban migration patterns, and the rise of “parent creators.” Family-centered travel, wellness, and design are trending upward, blending lifestyle with practicality.",
  "emotionalCulturalMeaning": "This trend represents a collective desire for belonging, continuity, and creation. In uncertain times, family offers purpose and peace. Parenting isn’t seen as giving up freedom — it’s reframed as building a future worth moving toward.",
  "whoIsLeading": "Millennial and older Gen Z parents, influencers like The Bucket List Family or Amber Fillerup, and brands embracing modern family aesthetics (e.g., Nuna, Lalo, KIA, and Patagonia).",
  "whoIsFollowing": "Young professionals and couples entering their 30s who value intentional living and view family as a design-led lifestyle decision rather than a traditional expectation.",
  "opportunityForBrands": "To align with this movement, brands can position family-oriented products as tools for empowered parenthood — where functionality, design, and emotion intersect. Campaigns that show parents thriving, not sacrificing, will resonate deeply.",
  "risksMissteps": "Over-romanticizing family life or trivializing its challenges can backfire. Authenticity and realism are key — today’s parents want empathy, not perfection.",
  "exampleInAction": "A KIA campaign titled “For Every First” — capturing the emotional rhythm of early parenthood: the first drive home, first nap in the backseat, first family trip. Each moment unfolds cinematically inside the Telluride, scored by quiet pride and gentle confidence. It’s a campaign about movement through milestones — where KIA isn’t just the car, it’s the constant companion for what’s next.",
